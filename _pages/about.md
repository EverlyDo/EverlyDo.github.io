Welcome!<br>I am preparing to apply for a master's program in `Computer Science`, <br> focusing on `Human-Computer Interaction`.<br>My goal is to leverage technology in connecting people and enhancing<br> their interactions through user-centered design.<br>I am passinate about Human-Computer Interaction, Computing Education, <br>and Social Computing. <br><br>I received my B.S. in `Software` and `Media Communication` from Dongseo University, where I built a solid foundation in technical skills and effective communication.<br>During my internship at CJ & Schwan’s in California, I gained hands-on experience <br>in IT support, which deepened my understanding of user experience enhancement. <br>This combination of academic knowledge and practical experience has prepared me <br>well for my next journey in the realm of `Human-Computer Interaction`! ✨
